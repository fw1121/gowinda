#summary A quick tour using a small sample data set

<wiki:toc max_depth="2"/>

= Introduction =
The following section provides a quick and fast introduction into the analysis of GO term enrichment with Gowinda. For the sake of this tutorial we provide a small artificial data set from _Drosophila melanogaster_ chromosome 2R. In these sample data we identified 348.701 SNPs and a GWAS-like study showed that 279 of those are associated with the trait of interest, lets say wing length. Furthermore the dataset contains an annotation of _D. melanogaster_ from !FlyBase and the GO associations from !FuncAssociate2. In the following section we demonstrate how to test, whether our set of candidate SNPs shows a significant enrichment for any GO terms.

== Tutorial Gowinda ==
The following sample data set contains SNPs, annotation and the GO associations for _D.melanogaster_ chromosome arm 2R. 
First obtain the sample data for the Walkthrough: http://gowinda.googlecode.com/files/data_gowinda_tutorial.zip

After unzipping the archive you should have the following files:
  * annotation.gtf: Annotation of the genome in the .gtf file format
  * annotation.gff: Annotation of the genome in the .gff file format
  * goassociations_cg.txt: A GO annotation file obtained from the !FuncAssociate2 web page
  * total_snps.txt: the set of all SNPs used in the GWAS-like  study
  * cand_snps.txt: the candidate SNPs. Some GWAS-like study showed that these SNPs are associated with a trait of interest, for example wing length.

== Unique gene based analysis ==

First we test whether the candidate SNPs show any enrichment for any GO category when counting every gene only once (`--mode gene`). Furthermore we want a SNP to be associated with a gene if the SNP position is within one of the exons or introns of the gene (`--gene-definition gene`).
